> With this experimental version, we are making a significant change in the way you think about, and build Redwood apps.

Redwood now becomes SSR-first, and moves away from the JAMStack model. You can decide whether your Routes are streamed from the server, then hydrated on the client *or* if you just want a static HTML page, based on the renderMode prop.


Some useful links:

- Checkout the original RFC with render modes here: [https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/6760](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/6760) - but remember the plan has diverged a little!
